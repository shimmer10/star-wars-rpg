## **This game is designed to be a Star Wars RPG**

### **It begins by allowing the user to choose a hero**
     * These disappear upon the user's choice of one
### **The opponent cards then build and allow the user to pick their first opponent**
     * All opponent cards stay to allow the player to fight all opponents
### **The attack button will appear only after the user has selected both a hero and an opponent**
     * The attack button then picks random numbers with which each character "attacks" dependent on their attack power
     * The hero's attack power will increase each time by it's initial value (ie. 4, 8, 12, 16, etc.)
### **When an opponent reaches a Hit Point value of 0 or below they are 'defeated'**
     * Their card will disappear and the arena text will prompt them to choose another
     * The player then fights that opponent and continues until all opponents, or the hero, is defeated
     * Once all opponents are defeated, the arena text changes to congratulate the player
### **When the hero reaches a Hit Point value of 0 or below they are 'defeated'**
     * The arena text will display the losing text
### **The player can play again clcking the reset button**
     * The reset button only appears when the player has defeated all opponents or is defeated
